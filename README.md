### 1. What is Big Data?
Big Data refers to datasets that are too large and complex to be processed using traditional data processing applications. 

It encompasses three main dimensions:

- Volume: The sheer amount of data generated from various sources, including social media, sensors, transactions, and more.

- Velocity: The speed at which data is generated and needs to be processed in real-time or near-real-time.

- Variety: The diverse types of data, including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data, such as text, images, videos, and sensor data.

### 2. Challenges of Big Data
- Storage: Storing large volumes of data efficiently and cost-effectively.
- Processing: Processing and analyzing data quickly to extract valuable insights.
- Scalability: Scaling infrastructure to handle increasing data volumes and processing demands.
- Complexity: Dealing with diverse data types and formats, as well as integrating data from various sources.
- Security and Privacy: Ensuring the security and privacy of sensitive data while maintaining compliance with regulations.

### 3. Distributed Computing
Distributed computing is a computing paradigm that involves multiple computers working together on a network to achieve a common goal. 

- Parallelism: Distributing data and computation across multiple nodes in a cluster to perform tasks concurrently, thereby reducing processing time.
- Fault Tolerance: Building resilience into distributed systems to ensure uninterrupted operation in the event of hardware failures or network issues.
- Scalability: Adding or removing resources dynamically to accommodate changing workloads and data volumes.
- Data Partitioning: Dividing datasets into smaller partitions and distributing them across nodes for parallel processing.
- Communication: Facilitating communication and coordination among nodes in the cluster to execute tasks efficiently.






It is not necessary that main function needs to be inside an object.


## Core Concepts of Spark
 ### RDD

- RDDs are the fundamental data structure in Spark, representing immutable distributed collection of elements that can be operated on in parallel across a cluster of machines.
- They allow parallel processing of data across a cluster in a fault-tolerant manner.
- RDDs can be created from external data sources or by transforming existing RDDs through operations.

  ### Properties
- Resilience:
They can recover from failures automatically and it is achieved through lineage information, which tracks the transformations applied to the base data.
- Distributed:
RDDs distribute data across multiple nodes in a cluster, allowing for parallel processing.
- Immutable:
Instead of modifying an RDD in place, transformations create new RDDs with the desired modifications.
- Lazily Evaluated:
Transformations on RDDs are not executed immediately, Spark waits until an action is called before executing the transformations, optimizing computation.

  ### Creating RDDs
- Loading external datasets (text files, CSV files, etc.)
- Parallelizing existing collections in memory
- Transforming existing RDDs through operations like map, filter, etc.

  ### Transformations on RDDs
 - Transformations are operations that create new RDDs from existing RDDs.
 - Common transformations include map, filter, flatMap, reduceByKey, sortByKey, etc.
 - Each transformation produces a new RDD, preserving the immutability of RDDs.

  ### Actions on RDDs
- Actions are operations that trigger computation and produce results.
- Examples of actions include count, collect, reduce, take, saveAsTextFile, etc.
- Actions are necessary to materialize the lazy transformations and obtain actual results.

 ## DAG
  - DAG stands for Directed Acyclic Graph. 
  - DAG is a fundamental concept that represents the logical execution plan of a Spark application.
  - It visualizes the sequence of transformations and actions applied to RDDs (Resilient Distributed Datasets) to achieve a specific computation or data processing task.

 
  ### Key Components of a DAG:
   - Vertices (Nodes): Vertices represent the RDDs and operations (transformations and actions) in the Spark application. Each vertex corresponds to a specific RDD or operation applied to an RDD.

   - Edges: Edges represent the dependencies between vertices. They indicate how data flows from one RDD to another through transformations. Edges are directed, meaning they specify the direction of data flow from parent RDDs to child RDDs.

  ### Characteristics of a DAG:
   - Directed: The edges in a DAG are directed, meaning they indicate the direction of data flow from parent RDDs to child RDDs. This directionality ensures that transformations are applied in the correct order.

   - Acyclic: A DAG is acyclic, meaning it does not contain any cycles or loops. This ensures that computations can be efficiently executed without getting stuck in infinite loops.

 ## Scala syntax and semantics
# Collections and Data Structures
### Arrays and Lists
 
   - Arrays and lists are both fundamental data structures in Scala for storing collections of elements.
   - While arrays are mutable and have a fixed size, lists are immutable and can grow or shrink dynamically.
   - Syntax: val arrayName: Array[ElementType] = Array(element1, element2, ...)
   - Initialization examples:
        ```
         val numbers: Array[Int] = Array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
         val emptyArray: Array[String] = new Array[String](5)
        ```
   - Accessing elements by index.
     ```
     val array = Array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
     val firstElement = array(0) // Accessing the first element
     ```
   - Modifying elements by index.
     ```
     val array = Array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
     array(2) = 10 // Updating the third element to 10
     ```
   - Iterating over elements using loops or higher-order functions.
     ```
     val array = Array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
     // Using a for loop
     for (element <- array) {
      println(element)
     }
     // Using foreach higher-order function
     array.foreach(element => println(element))
     ```
   - Finding the length of the array.
     ```
     val array = Array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
     val length = array.length
     println(s"Length of the array: $length")
     ```
   - Concatenating two arrays.
     ```
     val array1 = Array(1, 2, 3)
     val array2 = Array(4, 5, 6)
     val concatenatedArray = array1 ++ array2
     ```
   - Sorting elements in the array.
     ```
     val array = Array(3, 1, 5, 2, 4)
     val sortedArray = array.sorted
     ```
   - Searching for elements in the array.
     ```
     val array = Array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
     val element = 3
     val foundIndex = array.indexOf(element)
     if (foundIndex != -1) {
      println(s"Element $element found at index $foundIndex")
     } else {
     println(s"Element $element not found")
     }
     ```
   - Filtering elements based on a condition.
     ```
     val array = Array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
     val filteredArray = array.filter(_ % 2 == 0) // Filter even numbers
     ```
   - Applying a function to each element in the array.
     ```
     val array = Array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
     val squaredArray = array.map(x => x * x) // Square each element
     ```
  - Combining elements using a binary operation.
    ```
    val array = Array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
    val sum = array.reduce(_ + _) // Sum of all elements
    ```
  ### Lists
  ```
  val listName: List[ElementType] = List(element1, element2, ...)
 ```
### Immutable Sets
```
val immutableSet: Set[ElementType] = Set(element1, element2, ...)
```
### Mutable Sets
```
val mutableSet: mutable.Set[ElementType] = mutable.Set(element1, element2, ...)
```
### Immutable Maps
```
val immutableMap: Map[KeyType, ValueType] = Map(key1 -> value1, key2 -> value2, ...)
```
### Mutable Maps
```
val mutableMap: mutable.Map[KeyType, ValueType] = mutable.Map(key1 -> value1, key2 -> value2, ...)
```
## Operations on Sets
- Adding elements to a set.
  ```
  // Immutable Set
  val immutableSet = Set(1, 2, 3)
  val updatedImmutableSet = immutableSet + 4

  // Mutable Set
  val mutableSet = scala.collection.mutable.Set(1, 2, 3)
  mutableSet.add(4)
  ```
- Removing elements from a set.
 ```
 // Immutable Set
 val immutableSet = Set(1, 2, 3)
 val updatedImmutableSet = immutableSet - 2

 // Mutable Set
 val mutableSet = scala.collection.mutable.Set(1, 2, 3)
 mutableSet.remove(2)
 ```
- Checking if an element is present in a set.
  ```
  val set = Set(1, 2, 3)
  val containsElement = set.contains(2)
  ```
- Performing set operations like union, intersection, and difference.
  ```
  val set1 = Set(1, 2, 3)
  val set2 = Set(3, 4, 5)
  val unionSet = set1.union(set2)
  val intersectSet = set1.intersect(set2)
  val diffSet = set1.diff(set2)
  ```
## Operations on Maps
-  Adding and Updating Entries
  ```
  // Immutable Map
  val immutableMap = Map("a" -> 1, "b" -> 2)
  val updatedImmutableMap = immutableMap + ("c" -> 3)

  // Mutable Map
  val mutableMap = scala.collection.mutable.Map("a" -> 1, "b" -> 2)
  mutableMap.put("c", 3)
  ```

-  Removing Entries
  ```
  // Immutable Map
  val immutableMap = Map("a" -> 1, "b" -> 2)
  val updatedImmutableMap = immutableMap - "b"

  // Mutable Map
  val mutableMap = scala.collection.mutable.Map("a" -> 1, "b" -> 2)
  mutableMap.remove("b")
  ```
- Accessing Values
```
val map = Map("a" -> 1, "b" -> 2)
val value1 = map("a") // Using apply method
val value2Option = map.get("b") // Using get method (returns an Option)
```
### Tuples
Tuples are immutable collections in Scala used to group together elements of different types.
```
val personTuple = ("John", 30, true)
val name = personTuple._1
val age = personTuple._2
val isActive = personTuple._3
```
```
val personTuple = ("John", 30, true)
val (name, age, isActive) = personTuple
```
```
val nestedTuple = (("John", 30), ("Alice", 25))
```
