### 1. What is Big Data?
Big Data refers to datasets that are too large and complex to be processed using traditional data processing applications. 

It encompasses three main dimensions:

- Volume: The sheer amount of data generated from various sources, including social media, sensors, transactions, and more.

- Velocity: The speed at which data is generated and needs to be processed in real-time or near-real-time.

- Variety: The diverse types of data, including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data, such as text, images, videos, and sensor data.

### 2. Challenges of Big Data
- Storage: Storing large volumes of data efficiently and cost-effectively.
- Processing: Processing and analyzing data quickly to extract valuable insights.
- Scalability: Scaling infrastructure to handle increasing data volumes and processing demands.
- Complexity: Dealing with diverse data types and formats, as well as integrating data from various sources.
- Security and Privacy: Ensuring the security and privacy of sensitive data while maintaining compliance with regulations.

### 3. Distributed Computing
Distributed computing is a computing paradigm that involves multiple computers working together on a network to achieve a common goal. 

- Parallelism: Distributing data and computation across multiple nodes in a cluster to perform tasks concurrently, thereby reducing processing time.
- Fault Tolerance: Building resilience into distributed systems to ensure uninterrupted operation in the event of hardware failures or network issues.
- Scalability: Adding or removing resources dynamically to accommodate changing workloads and data volumes.
- Data Partitioning: Dividing datasets into smaller partitions and distributing them across nodes for parallel processing.
- Communication: Facilitating communication and coordination among nodes in the cluster to execute tasks efficiently.
